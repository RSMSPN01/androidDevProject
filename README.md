Android Development Journey

This repository contains Android projects built as part of my learning journey from basic to advanced Android development, started in January 2026.

Projects are created while following and applying concepts from the Google Android Developers official courses and documentation.

The purpose of this repo is to:

Practice Android fundamentals and modern components

Track real progress over time

Share clean, learning-focused project implementations

If you find any project useful, have feedback, or want to discuss Android development, feel free to reach out.
